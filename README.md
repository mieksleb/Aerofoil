# Aerofoil Lift Coefficient

This package contains a C-program that determines the lift coefficient $C_L$ of a 2D aeroifoil (airfoil) using the Smith-Hess Panel method [[1]](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.fl.22.010190.001351).
 as a function of the aerofoil geometry and the angle of attack $\alpha$. Uncertainty distributions in $C_L$ are then calculated usign the Signaloid.io cloud platform. This allows for the fast and efficient calculation of the distribution in $C_L$ given a distribution of input parameters. This allows for the determination of how error propogates through the program without having to execute the program for each sample of the distribution.

A more detailed description for the Hess-Smith panel method can be found in the README of the [src](src) directory. There are two versions of the aerofoil program, one for local use, and the other for the use on the Signaloid platform.

# Local Compilation

 The [local_src](local_src) directory includes all the system files required for local compilation. The program is simply compiled using the make command:

```bash
make
```
Make any appropriate changes to Makefile including the C-compiler and debug flags. The compiled program is called aerofoil.exe.

 ## Usage

You can execute the program with the command line arguments alpha as follows:

```bash
./aerofoil file_name alpha
```

This returns the number of data points for the aerofoil, the number of panels used in the calculation and the lift coefficient. For example for the aerofoil data file naca0012.dat at and angle of attack of $8^{\circ}$, the lift coefficient is calculated to be $C_L=0.9375$.


# Running on Signaloid.io

To run this program on the Signaloid.io cloud compute services, simply click on the icon at the top of the page. If you have compute time then you can compile and run this code via the button(), this is done automatically using the config.mk makefile. The compiled program now takes in distributions for the input variables. For example the command line arguments are now the mean angle of attack $\bar{\alpha}$, and its standard deviation $\sigma_{\alpha}$. Command line arguments are parsed into the field accessible by clicking on the () icon.

Distributions are defined from the UxHw library. For example a Gaussian distribution of the variable $\alpha$ with mean $\bar{\alpha}$ and standard distribution $\sigma_{\alpha}$ is
```c
double alpha = UxHwDoubleGaussDist(alpha_mean, alpha_std);
```

Any print statments of variables defined as distributions automatically produce uncertainty plots in the output (click the button).

# Uncertainty Results

The most relevant work on uncertainty in the angle of attack measurement is that of Paschereit _et al._ [[2]](https://wes.copernicus.org/articles/5/1771/2020/). In said paper uncertainty ranges for various values of $\alpha$ are given base on the surface pressure measurement method, e.g. for some standard conditions they report $\alpha=7.3^{\circ}\pm0.2^{\circ}$. It is not described explicitly how these values are distributed but it is shown that $\alpha$ is approximately bell-shaped with repsect to the roll $\phi$ and so we will make the assumption that the distribution in $\alpha$ is Gaussian in nature. Choosing a mean value of $\bar{\alpha}=7.3^{\circ}$ and a standard deviation of $\sigma_{\alpha}=0.2^{\circ}$, the $\alpha$ distribution outputted by the Signaloid processor was:

The corresponding output for $C_L$ was.

The mean lift was
